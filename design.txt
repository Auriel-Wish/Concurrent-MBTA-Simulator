Each train and passenger has its own thread. At the beginning, all threads are
started, and then they are joined right as the simulation ends.

For a train moving from one stop to the next, it acquires a lock on Train.class
Only one train should move at a time so that they don;t collide at the same station.

For passengers boarding and deboarding, use a lock on the train that they are
boarding/deboarding (because the train shouldn't move while the passenger is boarding).
Since the train must also not be moving, when it wants to move it must also acquire
its own lock (so it will lock on itself and Train.class).
